# Cloud Hosting Minetest
Predicting Computational and User Scalability of  Cloud-based Containerization Hosting

## Description 
This project is aimed at assessing whether hosting on the cloud-based platform can provide better result while hosting multiplayer video games, compared to the performance of traditional computer servers. 
In order to achieve this, different job deployment methods for computational performance effectiveness were assessed and compared. The multiplayer video game was hosted natively, in containerized form and in virtualized mode. 

## Techniques 
There are various techniques that can be used to monitor the performances. The task at hand is to simulate the Minetest game using various configurations - simulating on the native server and simulating on a software containers. Each of the methods have their unique benefits and disadvantages. The research evaluates the performance of configurations.
